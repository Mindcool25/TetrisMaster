# TetrisMaster
 Tetris written in the command line in c++. built to be able to be easily ran by machine learning bots for training.
 End goal is to write a bot modeled off of the NEAT algorythem to play and learn tetris, and then write a program to read the screen and beat my friend at tetris for me.
